# What is a version control system?
- Version control is a piece of software which allows you to record and preserve the history of changes made to directories and files.
- If you mess things up, you can retrieve an earlier version of your project.

# Storing versions without VCS
- Save a copy elsewhere?
- Save with a different name?
- How do you name different versions?
- What's different between them?
- Many of copies of nearly-identical but critically different files.

# Why use version control
## To store versions properly

- VCS treats files as one project - one current version on disk,
previous versions and variations are saved in a repository
- VCS starts with a base version of the project,
and only saves the subsequent changes you make
- In order to save a new revision, a commit message is required,
which explains why the changes were made.

## Changes are saved sequentially

- Understand what happened
- Backup
- Collaboration
